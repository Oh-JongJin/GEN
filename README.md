# SCOGEN

This project is a tool for generating music score images using artificial intelligence.

## Project Overview

The AI Music Score Generator uses deep learning models to create sheet music images from musical data. This tool can be useful for composers, music educators, and students.

## Key Features

- Generate score images from MIDI files
- Analyze audio files and convert them to sheet music
- Support for custom score styles
- Support for various instruments and music genres

## Required Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

- TensorFlow or PyTorch: For implementing deep learning models
- Music21: A toolkit for music theory, notation, and analysis
- Pretty_midi: For processing MIDI files
- Librosa: For music and audio analysis
- Pillow (PIL): For image processing
- NumPy: For numerical operations
- Matplotlib: For visualization
